<h2>energy monitoring and control</h2>

<p>This is a project developed to digitalize power monitoring and control for small scale industries using node-MCU for controlling the devices on-site.</p>

<p>The devices continuously send the power usage statistics to the cloud,where the admin can monitor the usage and predict the consumption before hand using saved data.</p>

<p>The cloud account can also be used to power on and off the devices and schedule their timings automatically</p>
